Your task is to analyze a video stream of the western harbour tunnel and count how many Tesla pass by every day COMP 3314 29 Reinforcement Learning The system (aka agent) improves its performance based on interactions with an environment Trial-and-Error approach Learning by doing The agent receives feedback (reward) from the environment This reward is not the correct ground truth It is a sample experience Extensive interaction with the environment allows agent to learn a series of actions that maximizes this reward COMP 3314 30 Reinforcement Learning - Example: Chess Agent decides upon a series of moves depending on state of board Environment is the board Reward can be defined as win or lose at the end of the game Outcome of each move results in different state of the environment Removing an opponent's chess piece from the board or threatening the queen is associated with a positive event Losing a chess piece to the opponent is associated with a negative event Note: Not every turn results in the removal of a chess piece Reinforcement learning is concerned with learning the series of steps by maximizing a reward based on immediate and delayed feedback COMP 3314 31 Reinforcement Learning - Example Learning to walk COMP 3314 32 Unsupervised Learning Unlabeled data / data of unknown structure Explores the structure of data Extract meaningful information without guidance of known outcome variable / reward function Examples Clustering Dimensionality reduction COMP 3314 33 Clustering Exploratory data analysis technique Organizes information into meaningful subgroups (clusters) without having any knowledge of group memberships Each cluster defines a group of objects that share a certain degree of similarity but are more dissimilar to objects in other clusters COMP 3314 34 Clustering - Example COMP 3314 35 Clustering - More Examples Human genetic clustering Sequence clustering Social network analysis Market research Grouping of shopping items COMP 3314 36 Dimensionality Reduction Often we are working with data of high dimensionality I.e., each observation comes with a high number of measurements High dimensional data can present a challenge Computational performance Predictive performance Visualization Dimensionality reduction is a commonly used approach in feature preprocessing Compress data onto a smaller dimensional subspace Retaining most relevant information COMP 3314 37 Dimensionality Reduction - Example High-dimensional feature set can be projected onto 1D, 2D or 3D feature spaces 3D to 2D example COMP 3314 38 Types of machine learning In the following we will consider three types of machine learning COMP 3314 39 Terminology and Notations Iris flower data set contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica Introduced in Fishers 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems Row A single flower sample Column Flower features (measurements in centimeters) COMP 3314 40 Terminology and Notations We will use a matrix and vector notation to refer to our data Each sample is a separate row in a feature matrix X, where each feature is stored as a separate column Iris dataset example 150 samples and four features are written as a 150 x 4 matrix X COMP 3314 41 Terminology and Notations We will use the superscript i to refer to the ith training sample, and the subscript j to refer to the jth dimension of the dataset For example x (i) = x (150) refers to the first dimension of the flower j 1 and sample 150 We use lowercase, bold-face letters to refer to vectors and uppercase, bold-face letters to refer to matrices Note that each row in the iris dataset X can be written as a four- dimensional row vector and each feature dimension is a 150-dimensional column vector COMP 3314 42 Roadmap Typical workflow for using ML in predictive modeling COMP 3314 43 Preprocessing Preprocessing of the data is a crucial steps in any ML application Feature selection, extraction and scaling Select and extract useful features from raw data Many algorithms also require that the selected features are on the same scale Dimensionality reduction May improve Computational performance Predictive performance Sampling Randomly divide the dataset into a separate training and test set to determine whether our algorithm not only performs well on the training set but also generalizes well to new data Keep the test set until the very end to evaluate the final model COMP 3314 44 Learning Model selection Compare algorithms and select the best performing model Cross-validation How de we know which model performs well on the final test dataset if we dont use this test set for model selection?
